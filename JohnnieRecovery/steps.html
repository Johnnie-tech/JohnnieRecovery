        <div class="box " style="background-color: rgb(204, 229, 230); ">
            <li>11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.

        <div class="box " style="background-color: rgb(194, 223, 211); ">
